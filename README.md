# INSERT APP NAME

This documentation tracks the progress of our app "INSERT APP NAME".

### Iteration 1
Iteration 1 Goals Accomplished:
- UI for Home, My Info, Contacts, and New Contact screens
- Mock UI for Group, Important, and Settings screens
- Instantiate Contacts

Iteration 1 Goals Unfinished:
- SQLite Database to store contacts, groups, and files
  - Ability to associate files with a Contact
- Search through Contacts screen using Search bar

**Comments:**
Iteration 1 started September 29, ended October 19.

Summary of Iteration 1: 
Tal worked on implementing NFC functionality to the app
Aaron worked on feature driven design of interface and testing for the app
Shane effectively built the entire UI and infrastructure for the app
Austin was responsible for implementing the entirety of the back end SQLite Database

As can be seen, the testing did not get done in a desirable fashion. Aaron was responsible for the test and greatly underestimated the task. In the future, it will be absolutely crucial to start testing earlier than in this iteration. 

We were unable to deliver on the User Stories dealing with basic NFC Functionality and some basic feature dealing with contacts. Just to be clear, the functionality is present and working in the code itself. There are just no tests to be able to prove that fact.
