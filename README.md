# INSERT APP NAME

This documentation tracks the progress of our app "INSERT APP NAME".

### Iteration 1
Iteration 1 Goals Accomplished:
- UI for Home, My Info, Contacts, and New Contact screens
- Mock UI for Group, Important, and Settings screens
- Instantiate Contacts
-SQLite database to store contacts, groups, etc.
  - note: database is present, not linked into app funcitonality yet

Iteration 1 Goals Unfinished:
- Ability to associate files with a Contact
- Search through Contacts screen using Search bar
- Implement test suite for work completed

**Comments:**
Iteration 1 started September 29, ended October 19.

Summary of Iteration 1: 
Tal worked on implementing NFC functionality to the app. Aaron worked on feature driven design of interface and testing for the app. Shane effectively built the entire UI and infrastructure for the app. Austin was responsible for implementing the entirety of the back end SQLite Database.

As can be seen, the testing suite corresponding to the scenarios was not completed. We were unable to deliver tests for the User Stories dealing with basic NFC Functionality and some basic features dealing with contacts. Our group greatly underestimated how much effort was involved in creating functional Espresso tests, and did not leave enough time at the end of the iteration to implement them fully. In the future, it will be absolutely crucial to start testing earlier than in this iteration. 

In summary, we overshot on the amount of work we should have completed in Iteration one. Going forward, we plan to implement more manageable work loads, and to have a higher quality and more thorough testing done on our implemented code.
